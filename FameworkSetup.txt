Framework Description
The framework which I followed is 'BDD CUCUMBER. Below is the brief description on how this framework works:
> Each page is defined as its own class.
> Actions  are represented as functions for a class.
> Tests only talk to the features files
> Class Inheritance can be used to define functionality to a set of pages.

Prerequisites
* Java should be installed and path should be in environment variables 
* Maven  should be installed path should be in environment variables .
* TestNG should be installed in execution IDE (Eclipse is suggestible).
* Import the framework to available IDE (Eclipse is suggestible).

Below are the steps to setup project properties:
---- Select Framework -> Right click -> Click on Properties
















After completing above setup, follow the below steps to install all the Maven dependencies
              Select Project --> Right click --> Select 'Run As' --> Click on 'Maven Install'
Results Location
After execution completed, you can find the HTML result file in the Web Reports folder in the framework.
If you run the whole suite at once, you will get one HTML result file, and if you run single test classes, you'll get individual result files under the same folder.

Property files
Each scenario we can implement as individual feature file and steps are implemented in step definitions class.
